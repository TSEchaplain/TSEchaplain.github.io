					<p>The TSE chaplaincy offers a safe, confidential space to simply talk and connect for clergy who often experience a level of disconnection and isolation. This service supports those in Toronto Southeast Presbytery who are engaged in the wide and various forms of leadership in Local Ministry Units and presbyters.</p>
          <p>I am your TSE chaplain, Michael Cottrell. I provide a place and presence of welcome, emphasizing those things that develop and nurture our life and work wherein the Spirit at the heart of life can be explored, celebrated and shared.</p>
          <p>With an open door, attentive ear, and compassionate heart and wisdom of experience, I strive to make a difference—one conversation, one event, one gathering at a time.</p>

						<p>I am Michael Cottrell. I engage in a Christian ministry of deep compassion and radical inclusion. Since the age of 19, I have been directly and personally engaged in expressions of the Christian faith. I bring forward my experience as a Roman Catholic monk, ordained priest in the Anglican Church of Canada and minister of sacrament and word in the United Church of Canada.</p>
            <p>During my 2015 sabbatical, I studied the history and tradition of Mahāyāna Buddhism, focusing on its contemplative practices. Although my studies were in the branch of Tibetan Buddhism, I practice and am a member of the Zen Buddhist Temple in Toronto.</p>
            <p>With the discipline of Buddhism and deep roots in the sacred practices of Christianity, I am grounded:</p>
            <p>in the holy which he names Spirit,<br>
            in the teaching of Jesus Christ and<br>
            in the wisdom of the people.</p>
            <p>I am always engaging in how both East and West spiritual practices relate to the here and now of life.</p>
            <p>I support people to develop a deeper rhythm and practice in their daily life. I co-lead and teach mindfulness practice in a contemplative experience.</p>
            <p>Ordained for 30 years, I have been teacher, counselor, spiritual leader, healer and therapist. I have completed post-graduate studies in psychotherapy along with a Masters of Divinity (London), undergraduate degree in Social Work (Waterloo) and a teaching certificate in Early Childhood Education and Child Development (Conestoga).</p>
            <p>I am a registered psychotherapist. I own the clinic Be Here Now Psychotherapy. With 10 therapists, we are supporting and creating change in the lives of individuals and the community.</p>
            <p class="cta">Let's talk. Call me at 416-880-8124.</p>

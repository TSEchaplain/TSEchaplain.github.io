					<p>The Toronto Southeast Presbytery chaplaincy offers a safe, confidential space to simply talk and connect for clergy and presbyters who often experience a level of disconnection and isolation. This service supports those in TSE who are engaged in the wide and various forms of leadership in Local Ministry Units.</p>
          <p>I am your TSE chaplain, Michael Cottrell. I provide a place and presence of welcome. Together, we emphasize those things that develop and nurture our life and work. Here, the Spirit, the heartbeat of life can be explored, celebrated and shared.</p>
          <p>With an open door, attentive ear, compassionate heart and wisdom of experience, I strive to make a difference—one conversation, one event, one gathering at a time.</p>

						<p>I am Michael Cottrell. I engage in a Christian ministry of deep compassion and radical inclusion. Since the age of 19, I have been directly and personally engaged in expressions of the Christian faith. I bring forward my experience as a Roman Catholic monk, ordained priest in the Anglican Church of Canada and minister of sacrament and word in the United Church of Canada.</p>
            <p>During my 2015 sabbatical, I studied the history and tradition of Mahāyāna Buddhism, focusing on its contemplative practices. Although my studies were in the branch of Tibetan Buddhism, I practice and am a member of the Zen Buddhist Temple in Toronto.</p>
            <p>With the discipline of Buddhism and deep roots in the sacred practices of Christianity, I am grounded:</p>
            <p>In the vitality of life, Spirit.<br>
            In the teaching of Jesus Christ and<br>
            in the wisdom of the people.</p>
            <p>I am always engaging in how both East and West spiritual practices relate to the here and now of life.</p>
            <p>I support people to develop a deeper rhythm and practice in their daily life. I co-lead and teach mindfulness practice in a contemplative worship experience.</p>
            <p>Ordained for 30 years, I have been teacher, counsellor, spiritual leader, healer and therapist. I have completed post-graduate studies in psychotherapy along with a Masters of Divinity (London), undergraduate degree in Social Work (Waterloo) and a teaching certificate in Early Childhood Education and Child Development (Conestoga).</p>
            <p>I am a registered psychotherapist. I own the clinic Be Here Now Psychotherapy. With 10 therapists, we are supporting and creating change in the lives of individuals and the community.</p>
